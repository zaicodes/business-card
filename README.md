# Business-card

Welcome to the small business card Repository! 

This repository showcases a sleek and professional business card designed using HTML and CSS. 

The card features a clean and minimalist layout with a white background, accentuated by subtle hints of blue and red along the edges for an eye-catching effect. 
To personalize the card, a recent photo of myself is incorporated. 

Additionally, the CSS file incorporates a dynamic element with the ":hover" selector, adding an interactive touch to the card.

This is one of my first practices using HTML, CSS which I enjoyed!
